# Automation-Test-Script-for-TradeMe-Motor-Model
Automation test scripts which simulated the users select different brands and models of cars for motors model with Page Object Model framework, BDD using Specflow, Gherkin and Selenium Webdrive with C#
I was responsible for verifying that the motors subpage on trademe.co.nz meets the different requirements including UI, functional, usability and so on.
I have designed, developed and executed automation test scripts that simulated the user specifies the brand and the model in search options and set up various check points which included but not limited to textfiled, errors message, colour and image to make sure the website has responded in right way.
